==tl;dr==

Set of scripts to calculate the guard fraction of Tor entry guards as
detailed in section "1.3. Age of guard as a factor on guard
probabilities" of proposal 236.

==Overview==

The scripts are meant to be run periodically and fed with historical
consensus data.

Specifically, the databaser script is responsible for reading past
consensuses and updating an sqlite3 database. Then the guardfraction
script reads the database and outputs a guardfraction file that is
meant to be read by Tor.

Directory authority operators are supposed to feed the databaser
script with 3 months worth of consensuses during initial
deployment. Then, before every voting period, the dirauth operators
should also feed the databaser script with the latest consensus. A
cron script will be used to do this.

==Example usage==

Put all your md consensuses in consensus_dir/. You can get yours from
CollecTor. For example:
$ mkdir guardfraction_data
$ cd guardfraction_data
$ mkdir consensus_dir summary_dir
$ cd consensus_dir
$ wget https://collector.torproject.org/archive/relay-descriptors/microdescs/microdescs-2014-07.tar.xz
$ tar xvf microdescs-2014-07.tar.xz
$ find microdescs-2014-07/consensus-microdesc/*/* -exec mv {} . \; # Get all consensuses in cwd

And now that we have all these consensuses saved locally, it's time to run the
guardfraction scripts:

$ python databaser.py --first-time guardfraction_data/consensus_dir/ 999
$ python guardfraction.py 999

Now you should have a file named 'guardfraction.output' in the cwd that
is meant to be read by little-t-tor.

==Dependencies==

stem is needed.

==Output file format==

This is the format of the guardfraction output file:

        written-at <date and time>
        n-inputs <number of consesuses parsed> <number of months considered>

        guard-seen <guard fpr 1> <guardfraction percentage> <number of consensus appearances>
        guard-seen <guard fpr 2> <guardfraction percentage> <number of consensus appearances>
        guard-seen <guard fpr 3> <guardfraction percentage> <number of consensus appearances>
        guard-seen <guard fpr 4> <guardfraction percentage> <number of consensus appearances>
        guard-seen <guard fpr 5> <guardfraction percentage> <number of consensus appearances>
        ...

for example here is a guardfraction output file for 9 consensuses over the past 3 months:

		written-at 2014-09-23 22:48:00.574353
		n-inputs 9 3
		guard-seen 4BD87C848E4DB3E10B759B8DC18D1294A715DAC4 100 9
		guard-seen D0EDB47BEAD32D26D0A837F7D5357EC3AD3B8777 100 9
		guard-seen 95B32375D0AC1CF6ABE3E1A8584DD5ADB3FACA60 100 9
        guard-seen 09BF459AB9702BC8F5EC9790D0812B0DEA8154D7 56 5
        guard-seen C9EBD47AEE8B7DCE24288953FA3518A56D57407D 33 3
        guard-seen BFB650BE1E42C874D97E34B45A2916FF94212600 33 3
        guard-seen 40D3E01ACC8C941788AC679F42F3C131B6E31933 11 1
